original test of parameter recovery

:ga was the parameter that differed between two participants - ~0.93 and ~0.62

very similar behavior, and ABC HBM demonstrated a lot of shrinkage

however, diagnostics suggested that low :ga values would result in different behavior, and may be easier to differentiate - next test
