# BCB-Modeling
The Brain, Cognition, and Behavior project is a burgeoning effort focused on comprehensive, integrative modeling of brain physiology, cognitive function, and behavior.

Based on the dissertation work of Patrick J. Rice.

The BCB-Modeling project seeks to leverage the [Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult) to characterize the relationships between brain physiology and human behavior, using cognitive modeling as a theoretically principled link between the two observable domains. This effort has potential to relate specific aspects of brain physiology to specific behavioral patterns on an individual level while specifying these relationships as the product of cognitive processing.

Currently, ACT-R cognitive models have been developed for the zero-back and n-back conditions of the HCP working memory task, with individual-specific parameters estimated for these models and related to observed resting-state fMRI activity of these same individuals. Future efforts may include:

- further development/merger of the working memory models
- improvement in the process of individual-specific parameter estimation
- relation of individual-specific parameters with task-related fMRI/MEG activity, and advancement of existing methods to relate task specific parameterization to resting-state activity
- development of models of additional HCP task paradigms
- expansion beyond the HCP dataset
